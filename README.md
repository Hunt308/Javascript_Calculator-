# Javascript_Calculator-
#A Calulator I made in August 2020 when I finished knowing all basic Javascript I learned functions and click events and this I made off the top of my head with no help just 
stuff I learned and it turned out really great. My name is Hunter and I called it Hunter's calculator and an image and message that tells you what you calculated
